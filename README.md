# Visualization-of-sorting-techniques

Visualization of 5 sorting techniques: bubble sort, insertion, selction, merge and quick sort.

Datasets used:
  1) NBA player of the week (real world dataset).
  2) Binomial distribution dataset (synthetic).
 

This code outputs a series of images for each sorting technique. These images are later combined and made into a video.
